                        <p>JavaScript's arrow functions might seem the same as regular functions on the surface, but
                            they have some very important differences: <br>

                            1.Syntactical differences <br>
                            2.this value (execution context) <br>
                            3.Usage as methods <br>
                            4.Usage as constructors <br>
                            5.arguments binding</p> <br>
                        Syntax <br> <br>
                        The first and most obvious difference between arrow functions and regular functions is their
                        syntax. Not only do they look different, but arrow functions also provide an implicit return
                        shorthand and allow parenthesis around a single argument to be omitted. <br> <br> <br>

                        Execution context <br> <br>
                        Inside a regular function, execution context (i.e. the value of this) is dynamic. This means
                        that the value of this depends on how the function was invoked (simple invocation, method
                        invocation, indirect invocation or constructor invocation). On the other hand, an arrow function
                        does not define its own execution context. This results in an arrow function's this being
                        resolved lexically (i.e. the scope in which the arrow function was defined). <br><br> <br>
                        Methods <br><br>
                        Due to arrow functions not defining their own execution context, they're not well-suited for
                        usage as methods. However, thanks to the Class fields proposal, arrow functions can be used as
                        methods inside classes, if your environment supports it. <br><br> <br>
                        Constructors <br><br>
                        Regular functions can be used as constructors, using the new keyword. Yet another consequence of
                        the lexical resolution of this inside arrow functions is that they cannot be used as
                        constructors. Using new with an arrow function results in a TypeError. <br><br> <br>
                        Arguments <br><br>
                        Another difference is the binding of the arguments object. Unlike regular functions, arrow
                        functions don't have their own arguments object. A modern alternative that circumvents this
                        limitation is the usage of rest parameters.

                        1.Map <br>
                        Map like filter & foreach takes a callback and run it against every element on the array but
                        whats makes it unique is it generate a new array based on your existing array. <br> <br>
                        2.Foreach <br>
                        Foreach takes a callback function and run that callback function on each element of array one by
                        one.For every element on the array we are calling a callback which gets element & its index
                        provided by foreach.

                        Basically forEach works as a traditional for loop looping over the array and providing you array
                        elements to do operations on them.<br> <br>
                        3. Filter <br>
                        The main difference between forEach and filter is that forEach just loop over the array and
                        executes the callback but filter executes the callback and check its return value. If the value
                        is true element remains in the resulting array but if the return value is false the element will
                        be removed for the resulting array. <br><br>
                        4.Find <br>
                        The find() method returns the value of the first element that passes a test. The find() method
                        executes a function for each array element. The find() method returns undefined if no elements
                        are found. The find() method does not execute the function for empty elements.
